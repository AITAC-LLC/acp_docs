# 06. Versioning

**Versioning** is a critical aspect of the ACP Framework, ensuring that <mark style="color:blue;">**assets**</mark>, <mark style="color:red;">**components**</mark>, and <mark style="color:green;">**parameters**</mark> can evolve over time while maintaining traceability and compatibility. The ACP system implements **versioning** at multiple levels to support data integrity and flexibility.

## 6.1 AssetClass Versioning

&#x20;  **6.1.1** Asset Classes are versioned to reflect changes in their structure or the composition of their components.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.1.2** Each new version of an AssetClass introduces a unique identifier, allowing for clear distinction between different iterations.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.1.3** When an AssetClass is updated, existing assets instantiated from previous versions remain unaffected, preserving their original structure and data.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.1.4** New assets created from the updated AssetClass will adhere to the latest version's definition.

## 6.2 ComponentClass Versioning

&#x20;  **6.2.1** Component Classes undergo versioning to accommodate modifications in their parameter definitions or structure.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.2.2** Each version of a ComponentClass carries a unique identifier.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.2.3** Updates to a ComponentClass do not impact existing components instantiated from prior versions.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.2.4** New components created from the updated ComponentClass will conform to the latest version's specifications.

## 6.3 Parameter Versioning

&#x20;  **6.3.1** Parameters inherit their versioning from their parent component.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.3.2** Updates to a ComponentClass may necessitate changes to its parameters, resulting in a new version of the component and, consequently, a new version for its parameters.

## 6.4 Version Compatibility

&#x20;  **6.3.1** The ACP system incorporates mechanisms to ensure compatibility between different versions of assets, components, and parameters.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.3.2** Compatibility rules define how data from older versions can be migrated or transformed to align with newer versions, facilitating seamless upgrades and data evolution.&#x20;

&#x20;  **6.3.3** The system may provide tools or guidelines for handling version conflicts or inconsistencies, ensuring data integrity during transitions between versions.
