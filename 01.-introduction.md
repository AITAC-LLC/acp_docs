# 01. Introduction

The **ACP Framework (Asset, Component, Parameter)** is a flexible framework for organizing information that may exist as data, physical objects, or abstract concepts not well suited to a traditional, rigid relational database or a fully unstructured system. It breaks these <mark style="color:blue;">**assets**</mark> into modular <mark style="color:red;">**components,**</mark> each with their own defined set of <mark style="color:green;">**parameters**</mark>, providing a scalable solution for handling complex relationships and evolving data in a structured yet adaptable way.

## 1.1 Purpose of ACP&#x20;

> **ACP seeks to provide a universal system that can **_**organize virtually anything.**_

The purpose of ACP is to develop an open-source framework capable of managing any type of information in a structured, scalable way, maintaining clear relationships and version control without enforcing rigid hierarchies. This flexibility makes it adaptable to various contexts, whether for managing digital assets, tracking metadata, or organizing complex datasets.

By supporting both strict and loose validation modes, ACP balances consistency with adaptability, making it useful for scenarios ranging from highly standardized environments to more fluid, evolving systems. The system is designed to link and chain parameters, enabling dynamic connections between data points and assets, promoting modularity and reusability.

**ACP seeks to provide a universal system that can **_**organize virtually anything**_, offering structure when needed and freedom when desired, ensuring that assets remain traceable, validated, and manageable across different domains.

## 1.2 Scope of this Document&#x20;

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Asset Component Parameter System (ACP), covering its foundational concepts, architecture, and operational framework. It explains how assets, components, and parameters are structured and linked, offering a clear understanding of how data and assets can be organized, validated, and versioned.

The focus is on defining the relationships between assets and their components, the role of classes in validation, and the mechanisms for linking and chaining parameters. This document is a technical reference, guiding the reader through the core features and functions of ACP, ensuring a solid grasp of its flexibility and capabilities for organizing complex or simple data systems.

## 1.3 Intended Audience

This technical specification is intended for developers, data architects, and system designers who are implementing or integrating the Asset Component Parameter System (ACP) into their projects. It is also suitable for technical stakeholders responsible for managing large or complex datasets, digital assets, or modular systems requiring flexible organization and validation.

Readers should have a basic understanding of data structures, version control, and JSON format, as this specification provides the technical framework and guidelines for effectively using ACP in various environments. The document assumes familiarity with hierarchical data systems but is designed to be accessible to those seeking an adaptable and scalable organization solution.\
