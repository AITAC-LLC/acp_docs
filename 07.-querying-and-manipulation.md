# 07. Querying and Manipulation

The ACP Framework provides a powerful and flexible query language to interact with and manipulate ACP data, enabling efficient retrieval, modification, and analysis of assets, components, and parameters. The query language is designed to be intuitive, expressive, and adaptable to various storage backends, ensuring seamless integration with different data storage solutions.

#### 7.1 Query Language Specification

The ACP query language utilizes a JSON-based schema to represent queries, allowing for structured and standardized expression of data retrieval and manipulation operations. The schema incorporates key elements like query type, target entity, filters, fields, sorting, and pagination options, providing a comprehensive framework for interacting with ACP data.

**Key Features**

* **SELECT Queries:** Retrieve specific assets, components, or parameters based on defined criteria using filters and optional field selection, sorting, and pagination.
* **INSERT Queries:** Create new assets or components, specifying their structure and data according to the ACP schema.
* **UPDATE Queries:** Modify existing assets, components, or parameters, applying updates to specific fields or properties.
* **DELETE Queries:** Remove assets or components from the system, ensuring data integrity and handling potential cascading effects on linked parameters.
* **Link Traversal:** Navigate relationships between assets, components, and parameters through linked parameters, enabling complex queries and data exploration.
* **Filtering and Sorting:** Apply filters based on property values and comparison operators, and sort results based on specified properties and directions.
* **Pagination:** Retrieve results in manageable chunks using limit and offset options, facilitating efficient handling of large datasets.

**Implementation**

The specific implementation of the ACP query language will depend on the chosen storage backend. The framework will provide a translation layer that converts high-level ACP queries into the equivalent queries or operations in the native language of the storage system. This ensures seamless integration and efficient execution of queries, regardless of the underlying data storage technology.

#### 7.2 CRUD Operations

The ACP query language supports the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing for comprehensive data management within the ACP system.

* **Create:** The `INSERT` query type enables the creation of new assets or components, populating them with initial data and establishing links as needed.
* **Read:** The `SELECT` query type facilitates data retrieval, allowing for flexible filtering, sorting, and selection of specific fields or properties.
* **Update:** The `UPDATE` query type enables modification of existing assets, components, or parameters, applying changes to their data or structure.
* **Delete:** The `DELETE` query type removes assets or components from the system, handling potential cascading effects on linked parameters and ensuring data integrity.

#### 7.3 Traversing Relationships

The ACP query language leverages the power of linked parameters to enable traversal of relationships between assets, components, and parameters. This allows for complex queries that explore connections and dependencies within the ACP data model.

* **Link Following:** Queries can specify link types (assetLink, componentLink, parameterLink) and navigate to linked entities, applying filters and retrieving specific data from those entities.
* **Chain Traversal:** The query language can handle chains of linked parameters, enabling exploration of multi-level relationships and dependencies across multiple assets.

#### 7.4 Filtering and Sorting

The ACP query language provides robust filtering and sorting capabilities, allowing users to refine their queries and retrieve data that meets specific criteria.

* **Filtering:** Queries can include filters based on property values and comparison operators, enabling selection of data that matches specific conditions.
* **Sorting:** Results can be sorted based on specified properties and directions (ascending or descending), facilitating organized presentation and analysis of data.

By combining these querying and manipulation capabilities, the ACP Framework empowers users to interact with their data effectively, extracting valuable insights, managing relationships, and adapting to evolving information needs.
